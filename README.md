# Physix

This is the repo for a java based vectors utility package and corresponding functions
 which I will use in my future physics simulations.
### Plans

We will implement both mutable and immutable vectors, and their respective operations.
Included functions:
* Scaling
* Adding vectors
* Multiplying Vectors
* Rotating vectors
* Operation chaining
